# McMansion_Hell
Zork like game inspired by https://mcmansionhell.com/

This is a choose your own adventure word game I made to learn Java.

More of a house tour than a game... there is no prize other than the satisfaction of finding the cat who likes presents ;)

Runnable Jar file titled McMansion_Hell.jar can be downloaded and run in the terminal using the java -jar command:
        
        java -jar <path to local runnable jar file>
